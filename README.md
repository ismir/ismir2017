# ISMIR2017

Archive of the ISMIR 2017 conference website

## Contributing

This repository contains a static archive of an ISMIR conference website. Changes to this website should be primarily for the maintenance and upkeep of hyperlinks on the web and any drift in web technologies.

To respect GitHub's file size limits on repositories, PDFs (publications, proceedings) and large multimedia objects are hosted elsewhere (Zenodo, YouTube, etc). Please **do not** add files that are 10MB or larger to this repository.

If you notice something to be in error, you are encouraged to create a pull request (ideal!) or simply create an issue.

## Deployment

Original website hard-coded a number of instances with `ism-ir2017.smcnus.org`
as the base domain.
